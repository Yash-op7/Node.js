# 1. The V8 JavaScript Engine
- parses and executes the js code.
- the dom and other web platform APIs (they all makeup runtime env) are provided by the browser 
- JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.

# 2. An introduction to the npm package manager
- npm is the standard package manager for Node.js.
- Yarn and pnpm are alternatives to npm cli.
- npm manages downloads of dependencies of your project.

## `npm`
- Used for managing packages, including installing and running scripts defined in your project.
## `npx`
- Primarily used for running packages without needing to install them globally.
example: npx create-react-app my-app


## Commands to install packages:
```cli
$ npm install
$ npm install <package-name>
$ npm install <package-name>@<version>
```
flags:

- --save-dev installs and adds the entry to the package.json file devDependencies
- --no-save installs but does not add the entry to the package.json file dependencies
- --save-optional installs and adds the entry to the package.json file optionalDependencies
- --no-optional will prevent optional dependencies from being installed

## commands for updating
```cli
$ npm update
$ npm update <package-name>
```

## Running Tasks
The package.json file supports a format for specifying command line tasks that can be run by using

For example:
```Shell
npm run <task-name>
and inside package.json:
{
  "scripts": {
    "start-dev": "node lib/server-development",
    "start": "node lib/server-production"
  }
}
```

## Webpack
Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes your applicationâ€™s various modules (JavaScript files, CSS, images, etc.) and bundles them into one or more output files, which can then be served to the browser. 
features:
- code splitting
- loaders: transform files ilke ts to js before bundling
- plugins: for further customization of the build process

# 3. Node.js, the difference between development and production
- no difference in node
- but a few libraries recognize using the NODE_ENV env var and default it to `development`
- In the wildly popular `express` framework, setting the NODE_ENV to production generally ensures that:
    - logging is kept to a minimum, essential level
    - more caching levels take place to optimize performance
- `export NODE_ENV=production`
# 4. Profiling Node.js Applications
- Profiling in Node.js applications refers to the process of analyzing the performance of your application to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and resource usage. 
- It helps you understand where your application spends most of its time, which can guide optimization efforts.
